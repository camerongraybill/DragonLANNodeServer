Smash Ladder Rules:
	Challenging:
		You can challenge anyone 50 rating or less above you, or 5 spots or less above you (Whichever one is more people)
		Challenges can be best of 3 or best of 5, determined by the challenger.
		The Winner always reports the match ( http://dusmashladder.com/report )
		You cannot challenge the same person more than once at the same event.
		When challenged you must accept to play at that time or schedule a time to play as soon as possible
		If a challenge is no longer valid when you go to play it (IE the challenger is now higher rank than the target) the match should not be played.
	Faulty reporting:
		If you report a match that did not happen, you will be given a strike. After 3 strikes you will be removed from the ladder.
		If you report a match that has already been reported, please contact an admin immediately to get it removed.
	All matches that go on the smash ladder follow traditional tournament format. The stage list and rules are the rules for the most recent Smash @ Marios Tournament (Easily found on Facebook)
